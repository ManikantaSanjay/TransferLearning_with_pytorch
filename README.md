# Transfer Learning With Pytorch

### Description : 
With the google collab notebook uploaded,we can clearly understand the power of Tranfer Learning.I have made use of the Imagewoof dataset to create a classification model by  making use of another pre-trained model Resnet-50,achieving a accuracy of over 90% by training with just 10 epochs;I have also shown how the model performs without the help of the pre-trained model giving an accuracy of just over 30% with the same number of epochs and not performing well enough for further more epochs also;thus marking the importance of Transfer Learning aka Pre-trained Models in the field of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
